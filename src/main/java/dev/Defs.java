5.3 Shape Expressions
A shape expression is composed of four kinds of objects combined with the algebraic operators And, Or and Not:

* a node constraint (NodeConstraint) that defines the set of allowed values of a node.
   These include specification of RDF node kind, literal datatype, XML String and numeric facets and enumeration of value sets.

* a shape constraint (Shape) that defines a constraint on the allowed neighbourhood of a node, that is, the allowed triples that contain this node as subject or object.



* an external shape (ShapeExternal) which is an extension mechanism to externally define e.g. functional shapes or prohibitively large value sets.

* a shape reference (shapeExprLabel) identifies another shape in the schema or an imported schema.
